Presenting geoscience research to K-12 students is a great way to provide science opportunities to underserved communities and demonstrate the possibility for careers in STEM. Plus, it is usually pretty fun.

I helped organize field trips for hundreds of students to visit University of Washington's IsoLab throughout several years.  This included a recurring field trip from a high school in South Seattle.

Through UW Rockin' Out, a graduate-student-run volunteer organization, I have also shared my science in elementary school classrooms, participated in science nights, and organized outdoor field trip opportunities for local schools.
