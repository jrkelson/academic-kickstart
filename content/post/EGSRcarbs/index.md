On a gray, rainy, and cold day in October, Tyler Huth and I went on what I thought would be a wild goose chase for secondary soil carbonates in the George Reserve in southern MI, about 20 miles outside of Ann Arbor. We found some spectacular pendants on clasts in a till deposit! We have a lot questions about this carbonate - is it actively dissolving or precipitating? Whats the source of calcium ions? We'll try to get back before the ground freezes to set up some monitoring.
