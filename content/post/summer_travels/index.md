Maybe most academics don't take long vacations, but I am taking this summer off! The flexibility in postdoc-start-date allowed me to take a break after graduating from UW in June. So, what am I doing with my time?

I will mostly be in Copenhagen, Denmark, exploring Scandinavian craft beer, swimming in the canals, going for bike rides, and finishing manuscripts from my PhD work. I also plan to travel to Italy, Norway, Czechia, and Sweden. Then I'll head back to North America for a backpacking trip in the Sierra and a sea kayaking trip in British Columbia before driving eastward to my new basecamp in Ann Arbor.
