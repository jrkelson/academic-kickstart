UW Earth and Space Sciences graduation really started off right - with a fire alarm! The alarm went off just when the chair, Ken Creager, was trying to get the ceremony started. Everyone evacuated, waited for the fire department to ascertain that there was not actually a fire, then we re-started the ceremony.

Also, I was honored to give the graduation speech.
