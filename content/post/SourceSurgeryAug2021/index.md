Sometimes it takes a whole month just to troubleshoot the mass spectrometer. Due to a long string of hypothesized problems and solutions, a group of IPL-ers collectively took apart and rebuilt the source of the Ny Perspective multiple times this month. Needless to say, we did not generate any usable isotope data during that time. But we did learn about the proper type of scotch-brite to order, and have an improved understanding of the lens stack!
