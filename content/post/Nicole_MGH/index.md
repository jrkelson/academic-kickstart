Nicole culminated her 2 years of undergraduate research with a presentation at the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium. She worked on a slough of projects relating to the climate reconstructions using the clumped isotope composition of soil carbonates. At this symposium, she presented results on using remotely-sensed soil moisture data to predict when soil carbonates form in North America. The jury is still out on whether or not remotely sensed soil moisture data is actually useful for this application.
