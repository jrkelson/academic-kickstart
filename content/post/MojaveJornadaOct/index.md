Naomi Levin and I continue to launch our CZ17O project studying soil carbonates across dryland ecosystems in the Western US with a trip to the Mojave Desert, California and the Jornada Basin, New Mexico. Both of these sites have monitoring networks that we are fortunate to tap into. We encountered some gorgeous soil carbonates and met with new colleagues who are eager to think about inorganic carbon in soils.
