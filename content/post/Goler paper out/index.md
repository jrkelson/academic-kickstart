I'm excited that the first paper from my NSF EAR postdoc fellowship has been accepted for publication in Geology! The initial goal of the project was to reconstruct seasonal variability in temperatures using marine oysters in the Goler Formation. The results turned out a little differently! We measured very light oxygen isotopes, and then started to explore what that would mean for the ancient landscape.
