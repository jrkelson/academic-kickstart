My clumped isotope calibration paper (Kelson et al., 2017) has been chosen to be included in a special issue for International Women's Day 2020. From Elsevier: "To mark International Womenâ€™s Day 2020, we are proud to promote a selection of recent and highly cited articles from lead female authors, who have published in top Elsevier Earth and Planetary Science journals.  These articles are free to view for 6 months."
