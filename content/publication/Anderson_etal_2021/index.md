abstract = "The potential for carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to independently constrain both the formation temperature of carbonate minerals and ﬂuid oxygen isotope composition allows insight into long-standing questions in the Earth sciences, but remaining31discrepancies between calibration schemes hamper interpretation of temperature measurements. To address discrepancies between calibrations, we designed and analyzed a33sample suite (41 total samples) with broad applicability across the geosciences, with an exceptionally wide range of formation temperatures, precipitation methods, and mineralogies. We see no statistically signiﬁcant oﬀset between sample types, although comparison of calcite and dolomite remains inconclusive. When data are reduced identically, the regression deﬁned by this study is nearly identical to that deﬁned by four previous calibration studies that used carbonate-based standardization; we combine these data to present a composite carbonate-standardized regression equation. Agreement across a wide range of temperature and sample types demonstrates a uniﬁed, broadly applicable clumped isotope thermometer calibration."
