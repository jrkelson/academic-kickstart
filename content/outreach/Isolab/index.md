Presenting geoscience research to K-12 students is a great way to provide science opportunities to underserved communities and demonstrate the possibility for careers in STEM. Plus, it is usually pretty fun.

In COVID times, I've been presenting to middle and high school audiences from the comfort of my home. They ask the toughest questions about climate change!

I helped organize field trips for hundreds of students to visit University of Washington's IsoLab throughout several years.  This included a recurring field trip from a high school in South Seattle.

Through UW Rockin' Out, a graduate-student-run volunteer organization, I have also shared my science in elementary school classrooms, participated in science nights, and organized outdoor field trip opportunities for local schools.
