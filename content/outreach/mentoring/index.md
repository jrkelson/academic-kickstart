I enjoy mentoring undergraduates in field and laboratory research. I have mentored several undergraduate students at the University of Washington and at the University of Michigan. Through the ongoing CZ17O project, I've recruited four students at UMich who are helping at various levels, including mapping geomorphology, sample preparation, and sample analysis on a mass spectrometer. I have students at Boise State and University of Texas El Paso who are collecting soil samples on an ongoing basis in Idaho and New Mexico. 

With undergraduates Margaret, Miriam and Kirsten, and graduate student from IsoPaleoLab @ UMich, we took a all-hands-on-deck field trip to our local outcrop of soils in the Edwin S George Reserve near Hell, MI in September 2021.

I had the pleasure of watching Nicole graduate with her BS in Earth & Space Sciences - the same day that I walked for my PhD.

It is helpful to have an army of people when trying to grow synthetic calcite! Several undergraduates, including Shana, were instrumental to precipitating synthetic calcite as a part of my clumped isotope calibration paper.
